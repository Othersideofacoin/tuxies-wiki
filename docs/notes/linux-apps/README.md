:::info
A list of very useful or very cool apps!

**Have fun exploring!**
:::

:::tip
P.S. You can always just search for these apps in your app store (if your desktop environment or distro comes with one) instead of using the terminal.

## Setting up Flatpak

You might need to set up Flatpak on your distro before you can start installing them. If you haven’t set up Flatpak on your computer, check [here](https://flathub.org/setup).

If you want to also have the option to install Flatpaks on a per-user basis (other users of your computer won’t see those apps when they log in), you can add the Flathub repository for your user by running this line.

:::tabs

@tab Fedora

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```
