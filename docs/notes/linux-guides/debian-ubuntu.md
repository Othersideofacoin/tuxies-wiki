# Spiral Linux
:::tip Spiral?
Spiral linux is to Debian what EndeavorOS is to Arch. This means it provides a basic preconfigured setup to get you started while also offering some nice bonuses such as BTRFS subvolume layout that allows for automatic Snapper snapshots, optimal font rendering, preinstalled tlp power configuration, and others.
