:::important The following list of Linux vocabularies are commonly used within the Linux community, thus it's extremely helpful not only while navigating Tuxie's Wiki but also for future reference. The definitions are simplified to be beginner friendly.

:::warning TODO: Simplifying definitions for beginners

:::

## **Core Concepts**

**Linux**: A free, open-source Unix-like operating system kernel, often used to refer to entire OS distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora).

**Kernel**: The core part of the OS that manages hardware, processes, and memory.

**Terminal**: A text-based interface to interact with the OS by typing commands.

**Shell**: The command-line interpreter (e.g., Bash, Zsh) that executes user commands.

**Bash (Bourne Again SHell)**: The default shell in most Linux distributions.

**CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A text-based way to interact with the system (vs. GUI).

**GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: A visual interface with windows, icons, and menus (e.g., GNOME, KDE).

**Desktop Environment (DE)**: A complete graphical interface (e.g., GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE).

**Window Manager**: Software that controls window placement and appearance (e.g., i3, Openbox).

## **System & File Management**

**Root**: The superuser/admin with full system control (root user, /root directory).

**sudo (SuperUser DO)**: A command to run programs with root privileges.

**Path**: The location of a file/directory (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3`).

**Symlink (Symbolic Link)**: A shortcut pointing to another file/directory (like Windows shortcuts).

**Alias**: A custom shortcut for a command (e.g., `alias ll='ls -la'`).

## **Package & Software Management**

**Package Manager**: A tool to install/remove software (e.g., `apt` — Debian, `dnf` — Fedora, `pacman` — Arch).

**Repository (Repo)**: A server hosting software packages for download.

**Dependency**: Additional software required for a program to run.

**Flatpak**: A universal package format that works across Linux distros (sandboxed).

## **Networking & Permissions**

**SSH (Secure Shell)**: A protocol for secure remote login (`ssh user@host`).

**IP (Internet Protocol)**: A unique address for network communication (`ifconfig`/`ip a`).

## **Processes & System Control**

**Daemon**: A background service (e.g., `sshd` for SSH).

**Systemd**: A modern init system managing services (`systemctl start/stop`).

<!-- ## Must know vocabularies

Linux: A free, open-source Unix-like operating system (like Windows and MacOS), often used to cover the entirety of different distributions e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch.

Kernel: The intermidiate part or a bridge that links software applications and hardware. It manages system resources including CPU, memory, disks, processes, device drivers, etc.

Terminal: A text-based interface to control the operating system.

Shell: The command-line interpreter (e.g., Bash, Zsh) that executes user commands.

Bash: The default shell in most Linux distributions.

Desktop Environment (DE): A complete graphical interface (e.g., GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE).
