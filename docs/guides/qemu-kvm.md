## **What is QEMU/KVM?**

In essence, QEMU/KVM are used to achieve virtual machines (VM) on Linux with high performanace through GPU acceleration. It offers more customibility and performance comparing with other existing VM softwares such as [GNOME Boxes]() and [VMware]().

QEMU stands for Quick Emulator is the main virtualization software that allows full-system emulation. KVM stands for Kernel-based Virtual Machine is a Linux kernel module that allows VM to run efficiently at kernel level.
